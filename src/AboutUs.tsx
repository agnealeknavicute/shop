          Smoking is a widely recognized public health issue that has
          significant impacts on both individuals and society as a whole.
          Despite the well-documented risks, millions of people worldwide
          continue to smoke. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable
          diseases, including heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory
          disorders. The addictive nature of nicotine makes quitting
          challenging, often requiring multiple attempts. Public health
          campaigns and smoking cessation programs aim to reduce smoking rates,
          emphasizing the health benefits of quitting and the dangers of
          secondhand smoke. However, smoking remains a deeply ingrained habit
          for many, influenced by factors such as stress, social pressures, and
          targeted marketing by tobacco companies.

          The financial cost of smoking, along with its health consequences,
          continues to fuel the debate over tobacco regulations and the need for
          stricter controls to protect public health. The health consequences of
          smoking are severe and far-reaching. Smoking is the primary cause of
          lung cancer, responsible for the majority of cases. It also
          contributes to a range of other cancers, including those of the mouth,
          throat, esophagus, and bladder. In addition to cancer, smoking is a
          major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive
          pulmonary disease (COPD), and a host of other respiratory conditions.
          The damage caused by smoking is not limited to the smoker; secondhand
          smoke also poses serious health risks to those exposed, particularly
          children and pregnant women. Despite these dangers, smoking continues
          to be a widespread habit. Tobacco companies have long employed
          sophisticated marketing tactics to attract new smokers, often
          targeting vulnerable populations such as young people and those in
          low-income communities.
